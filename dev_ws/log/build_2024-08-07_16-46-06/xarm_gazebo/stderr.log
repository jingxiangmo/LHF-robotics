CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcontrol_toolbox.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "control_toolbox", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "control_toolbox"
  with any of the following names:

    control_toolboxConfig.cmake
    control_toolbox-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "control_toolbox" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "control_toolbox_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "control_toolbox" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
